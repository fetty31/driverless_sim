# Tracker parameters

Topics:
  Input:
    State: /driverless/state
    Track: /driverless/track
  Output:
    Cones: /tracker/cones
    ConesDown: /tracker/conesdown
    Laptime: /tracker/lapinfo
    Moved: /tracker/moved

Service:
  Reset: /tracker/reset

Frequency: 50 # [Hz]

Noise: # added gaussian error in cone's positions
  Mean: 0.0
  Std: 0.01

Detection:
  Radius: 20.0          # [m]
  VisionAngle: 180.0    # [deg]

Likelihood: 0.9 # Given a cone inside the car's field of view, likelihood of detecting it [0,1]. 

MinVel: 0.1 # Minimum velocity to start counting laptime

BoundingBox: # Different from the dynamic model dimensions; these should include aerodynamic dimensions (which usually bring down cones :( )
  Lf: 1.5   # [m]
  Lr: 1.0
  T: 1.42

ConesMoving: true # Whether hit cones are moved (if true, tracker/start.py frequency should be increased to at least 10Hz for a smooth visualization)
